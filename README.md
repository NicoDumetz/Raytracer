# üåå Raytracer

Raytracer is a C++ project developed to render realistic 3D scenes by simulating the physical behavior of light using **ray tracing**.  


## ‚öôÔ∏è Ray tracing

Ray tracing is a technique for generating photorealistic images by simulating the inverse path of light rays.  
Here‚Äôs a simplified explanation of how our engine works:

1. **Ray Casting**: For each pixel in the final image, a virtual "ray" is launched from the camera into the scene.
2. **Intersection Detection**: The ray is tested against all objects (primitives) to find what it hits first.
3. **Shading**: Once a hit is found, the engine computes the color at the impact point based on:
   - Object material (flat color, reflective, transparent‚Ä¶)
   - Lights in the scene (ambient, directional, point lights‚Ä¶)
   - Shadows (if the point is occluded from a light source)
4. **Output**: The result is written pixel by pixel into a `.ppm` image or renderer like `SFML`.

The scene is fully described in an external configuration file (`.cfg`) which is parsed using **libconfig++**.

## üì¶ Features

The raytracer is fully **modular** and built around a **plugin system**. Every major component of the rendering pipeline (camera, primitives, lights, materials, renderers) is compiled as a **shared object plugin** (`.so`) and loaded dynamically at runtime.

Plugins are stored in the `./plugins/` directory and are discovered based on their registered type and name. This design allows easy extensibility: adding a new shape or lighting model doesn't require changing the engine core.

### üîß Core Principle

Each plugin implements a specific interface:

| Plugin Type | C++ Interface            |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Camera      | `ICamera`                |
| Primitive   | `IPrimitive`             |
| Light       | `ILight`                 |
| Material    | `IMaterial`              |
| Renderer    | `IRenderer`              |

All geometric computations are performed in **object space**, and transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) are applied using **transform matrices**. Intersection tests are done using **analytical or parametric equations**, then transformed back to world space for lighting and shading.

### üé• Camera Plugins

The camera plugin is responsible for generating rays per pixel based on image resolution, position, target, up vector, and field of view.

| Plugin        | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `r_c_camera`  | Perspective pinhole camera using look-at vector and FOV. Generates rays in world space per pixel |

**Math**:  
- Converts pixel (x, y) to NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates)  
- Applies aspect ratio and FOV scaling  
- Constructs direction:  
  `dir = forward + right * x + up * y`, normalized

### üß± Primitive Plugins

Primitives are geometric objects that rays can intersect. Each primitive implements a `hit(ray)` function to compute intersections.

| Plugin                | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### üîÑ Supported Transformations (All Primitives)

Each primitive supports a set of geometric transformations, applied via `TransformMatrix` before intersection testing:

| Transformation | Description                                             | Math Applied |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Translation** | Moves the object in space                              | Added as column in affine matrix |
| **Scaling**     | Changes size (uniform or per axis)                     | Diagonal scaling matrix |
| **Rotation X/Y/Z** | Rotates object around world axes                  | Trigonometric rotation matrices |

### üí° Light Plugins

`color = intensity √ó max(0, dot(N, L))`  
Where `N` is surface normal, `L` is normalized light direction

### üé® Material Plugins

Materials define how a surface reflects or transmits light. They set visual properties like color, reflectivity, or texture.

| Plugin              | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `r_m_flatcolor`     | Constant color material (no lighting interaction)                                                |

| `r_m_glass`         | Simulates reflection and refraction using Schlick's approximation with index of refraction (IOR) |
| `r_m_gradient`      | Vertical Y-gradient interpolating between two colors                                             |
| `r_m_mirror`        | Fully reflective material (reflectivity = 1.0)                                                   |
| `r_m_perlin`        | Procedural texture using 3D Perlin noise between two colors                                      |
| `r_m_transparent`   | Semi-transparent material with fixed reflectivity and refractive index                          |

**Advanced models**:
- **Schlick‚Äôs Approximation** (used in reflective/refractive materials):

  This formula estimates how much light is reflected vs refracted depending on the viewing angle and material properties:

  **R(Œ∏) ‚âà R‚ÇÄ + (1 - R‚ÇÄ) √ó (1 - cos(Œ∏))‚Åµ**

  Where:
  - **Œ∏** is the angle between the view ray and the surface normal
  - **R‚ÇÄ** is the reflectance at normal incidence, calculated as:

    **R‚ÇÄ = ((1 - n) / (1 + n))¬≤**

    with **n** being the **index of refraction** (IOR) of the material.

  This model gives a smooth transition between reflection and transparency, making glass or water more realistic.


- **Perlin noise**:  
  Generates natural randomness based on gradients and smooth interpolation in 3D space

### üñºÔ∏è Renderer Plugin

Renderers output the computed image. The default output is `.ppm`, but plugins like SFML enable real-time previews.

| Plugin        | Description                                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

### ‚ûï Add Your Own Plugin

To create a new plugin (primitive, light, material, etc.), refer to:

**üìÑ [`docs/technical.md`](./docs/technical.md)**  
This file includes step-by-step instructions for implementing, registering, compiling, and testing a plugin using our plugin architecture.

## üöÄ How to Run

Once compiled, run the raytracer with:

```sh
./raytracer <your_scene.cfg>
```

This will parse the scene, run the rendering engine, and write the output to `output.ppm` (by default).

You can specify a custom output file using `-o`:

```sh
./raytracer scenes/demo_sphere.cfg -o result.ppm
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions


```sh
./build_script.sh
./raytracer scenes/example.cfg
```

Plugins are compiled automatically into the `./plugins/` folder.

### üìÅ Scene Files

Scene configuration files are written using the `libconfig++` format.

They describe:
- Camera settings
- Primitives and their transforms
- Lighting setup
- Material assignments
